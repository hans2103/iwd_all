# IWD All Plugin - Magento 1

This is IWD Agency's all plugin which is required by most of their Magento 1 modules.

I am not the developer of this extension and can provide no support. 
This is simply a repository used by my Magento projects as a dependancy.

## Installation

You can install via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
```
composer config repositories.IWD_All git git@github.com:hans2103/iwd_all.git
composer require hans2103/iwd_all ~2.2
```

Or via [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman)

```
modman clone https://github.com/hans2103/iwd_all
```

## Notes
IWD, changed the versioning of the plugin from 2.1 back down to 1.2 (possibly for a future Magento 2 version?)
